          <p>
           I’m currently an independent Junior Front-end Developer at Responsive Digital. I’ve had the privilege of having a wise and hardworking mentor and a team of self-motivated developer that are always keen to share their knowledge
          </p>
          <p>Being in this healthy motivational environment, compels me to strive and give each project my very best effort and simultaniously grow mentally.</p>
          <p>My work is to build the front-end of Website and the languages that I use include HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript or JQuery. I’m a great team player and I also work well alone. I take pride in the work that I produce no matter the scale of a project.</p>

          </h4>
          <p>
            Code4CT equips high potential female learners with the coding, problem-solving and life skills that will allow them to leverage technology to contribute meaningfully to South Africa’s innovation system.
            <br>
            <br> During my role as a Code Camp facilitator, I took on the following responsibilities:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Running Raspberry Pi workshops for the learners (grade 10 girls)</li>
            <li>Acting as a support facilitator for Design Thinking workshops</li>
            <li>Supporting and managing learners in the hostel and generally supporting them in their personal development.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I volunteer on some Saturdays to represent Code4CT as their ambassador, facilitate or head a workshop. These workshops are for female learners as mentioned above, and it is my way of giving back to the organisation and giving the learners an opportunity
            that was once given to me.
